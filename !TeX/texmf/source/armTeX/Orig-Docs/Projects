Here are some things left to do, roughly in the order I am thinking of
implementing them.

* If lex or yacc aren't found, have configure use the distribution files.

* Merge Ken's dynamic array changes.

* Give TeX options: -name to read a particular .fmt file;
  -output-file to say where DVI file should go (including stdout);
  -no-timestamps to omit timestamps in the dvi file (for testing).

* Have bibtex -verbose print full pathnames.

* Do the documentation in Texinfo, and generate the man pages automatically.

* Use standard error where appropriate.

* Exit with bad status on errors.

* Check status on all writes.

* Make MFT understand tabs.  Maybe make \write and \special understand tabs?

* -charset=iso8859 (for example) to specify what the visible characters are.

* -trace-fonts, -trace-inputs, etc. to show what's getting read where.
  Also trace MakeTeX*.

* Implement a way to get all-octal character codes in VFtoVP and TFtoPL,
  in the out_char routine.

* Make initex an option, instead of a second program?

* Why does web2c.yacc have shift/reduce conflicts? 

* Make DVItype not do a dialog, a la GFtype.  Generally unixify all the
  programs. 

* Make web2c handle fields correctly, i.e., to put the field identifier
  in the symbol table of the type, instead of the global symbol table. 
  This would simplify the GFtoDVI change file a fair amount.

* Make web2c handle variant records.  This would make the TeX, Metafont,
  and GFtoDVI change files all simpler.

* Echo \openout filenames, for ``security'' reasons.
