[ ftp.nwc: 21 February 1993 

  Most of the information in this file can be found in readme1.ftp
  and readme2.ftp, dated 01/07/93, in pub/unixtex on 
  byron.u.washington.edu (128.95.48.32).

  Numerical Internet addresses are subject to change.  If your name
  server does not recognize a hostname, and if you find that one of 
  the Internet addresses listed below is no longer valid, please get 
  in touch with us, and we shall look up the current numerical address 
  for you. ]


Most people who get in touch with us are aiming to install plain TeX,
LaTeX, SliTeX, and plain Metafont, a previewer that will work in an X 
environment, and a PostScript printer driver.  We hope you will not mind 
if we limit ourselves to addressing only the simplest means by which 
to attain these three aims via ftp.  

Thanks to Karl Berry, who is the Unix System Coordination Chair for TUG, 
and maintainer of WEB-to-C, and without whom TeX users with Unix machines 
would be nowhere, retrieval can be done from the following three sites 
(all of which have many useful things for TeX users other than what we 
will be focussing on here).  The steps are:

   ftp ftp.cs.umb.edu		(Internet address: 158.121.104.33)

	ftp> cd pub/tex
	ftp> get modes.mf	[place in whatever you will be defining 
				 as your MFINPUTS directory in your
				 ./web2c-<version>/lib/site.h file]
	ftp> bi
	ftp> get dvipsk.tar.Z	[PostScript printer driver source:
				 unpacks into ./dvipsk-<version>]

	ftp> get web.tar.Z	[WEB source for TeX, Metafont, & family:
				 unpacks into ./web2c-<version>]

	ftp> get web2c.tar.Z	[web2c source:
				 unpacks into ./web2c-<version>]

	ftp> get xdvik.tar.Z	[X-windows previewer source:
				 unpacks into ./xdvik-<version>]
	ftp> quit		[end ftp session]


   ftp labrea.stanford.edu	(Internet address: 36.8.0.112)

	ftp> cd tex/bibtex
	ftp> prompt		[to avoid being asked about the retrieval
				 of each file covered by a wildcard symbol]
	ftp> mget *.bib		[place in your BIBINPUTS directory]
	ftp> mget *.bst		[place in your TEXINPUTS directory]
	ftp> mget *.sty		[place in your TEXINPUTS directory]
	ftp> mget *.tex		[place in your TEXINPUTS directory]
	ftp> cd ../cm
	ftp> mget *.mf		[place in MFINPUTS directory]
	ftp> cd ../lib		
	ftp> mget *		[place *.mf files in MFINPUTS directory,
				 *.mft and *.tex in TEXINPUTS directory]
	ftp> cd ../fonts	
	ftp> bi
	ftp> mget *.tfm		[place in TEXFONTS directory]

     For a basic set of 300 dpi Computer Modern fonts generated for a 
     Canon CX engine (not absolutely necessary, for dvips will generate 
     fonts as needed):

	ftp> cd ../gf
	ftp> mget *		[These are in gf format.  To convert
				 them into pk format, use "gftopk" which, 
				 along with its man page, will be made and 
				 installed during the web2c make of TeX.]
	ftp> quit		[end ftp session]


   ftp niord.shsu.edu		(Internet address: 192.92.115.8)

	ftp> cd latex		
	ftp> bi
	ftp> get LATEX-25MAR1992.TAR_Z

		[Rename this to latex-25mar92.tar.Z, before
		 extraction.

		 This should unbundle into 4 directories.
		 The general/*.tex and sty/*.sty files 
		 should be placed in your TEXINPUTS directory;
		 the fonts/*.mf files into MFINPUTS.]

	ftp> quit	[end ftp session]


We believe this covers the retrieval of the essential files.  
Each of the three packages from ftp.cs.umb.edu contains its own 
installation instructions.  Begin with ./web2c-<version>/README.

If you are installing this material for the first time, you may not find 
the process as easy as installing directly from our distribution tape, 
but ease is a matter of degree.  All installation processes require
careful attention to detail, and knowledge of your system.  
Festina Lente (Make Haste Slowly), and you improve your chances 
of success.

For other programs, input files, and fonts, the major TeX archives are:

Domestic (USA) sites:

	e-math.ams.com		130.44.1.100	[AMS-TeX, AMS-LaTeX]
	niord.shsu.edu		192.92.115.8
	science.utah.edu	128.110.198.2
	ymir.claremont.edu	134.173.21.23	

European sites:

	archive.cs.ruu.nl	131.211.80.17
	ftp.th-darmstadt.de	130.83.55.75
	ftp.uni-stuttgart.de	129.69.1.12
	tex.aston.ac.uk		134.151.40.18

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Network users interested in TeX software will find much that is useful in 
the following FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) documents on ftp.uu.net 
(137.39.1.9) in ~/usenet/comp.text.tex:

	T,_L,_e.:_F_A_Q_w_A_M	[TeX,LaTeX,etc.:FAQ with Answers(Monthly)]
	TeX-FAQ-supplement_*

A beautifully done index of macros for TeX and LaTeX is available on 
theory.lcs.mit.edu (18.52.0.92) in ~/pub/tex/TeX-index.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are concerned about connect-time, search or retrieval problems, 
or will require help in building and installing the basic TeX/LaTeX 
and Metafont programs on your machines, you may wish to consider ordering 
a distribution tape from

	Northwest Computing Support Center
	DR-10, Thomson Hall 35
	University of Washington
	Seattle WA  98195

	phone: (206) 543-6259

A distribution fee in the area of $210 for domestic sites covers the 
expenses of putting together and maintaining the distribution, its 
equipment, and installation-support services.  

E-mail queries concerning the distribution tape should be sent to: 

   elisabet@u.washington.edu   (Elizabeth Tachikawa), 

otherwise to:  

   mackay@cs.washington.edu    (Dr. Pierre A. MacKay).

Until we can do more, we hope that this will help.
