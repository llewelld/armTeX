% original texfonts.map -- define aliases for fontnames.
% 
% (If you change or delete `original' on the previous line, web2c won't
% install its texfonts.map over this file.)
% 
% First column is real filename; second is alias; others are ignored.
% Spaces and/or tabs separate columns.
% Blank lines are ignored.
% Comments (obviously) start with %.
% 
% Null bytes will confuse the programs, and a CR at the end of a line is
% removed for DOS's sake, but any other characters will be considered
% part of the text, and any length is ok.
% 
% If an alias here has an extension, it will match only those files with
% that extension; otherwise, it will match anything with the same root,
% regardless of extension.  For example, `foo.tfm' matches only
% `foo.tfm'; but `foo' matches `foo.tfm', `foo.vf', `foo.300pk',
% whatever.
% 
% Any existing file will be used in preference to a file that exists via
% an alias.  For example, suppose you have a file `foo.tfm' and this
% file defines `foo' as an alias for `bar'.  `foo.tfm' will be used, not
% `bar.tfm'.

% These fonts have been named both `circle10' and `lcircle10'.  But
% `lcirc10' would be better, anyway, as it's short enough for DOS.
% Allow any of these variations to mean any of the others.
